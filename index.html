            <p1>Hello and welcome to my personal website. In the following you will see some of my work.
                I developed a few games and apps. All of my published projects can be found below.
                My goal with this website is to learn how to create a website myself and to present and
                show my work. This website was entirely coded by myself and serves as a way to learn some
                web development.
